## DRIFTER SIMULATION TOOLBOX FOR MATLAB ##

v9.0


Tools for simulating drifters given gridded vector data, such as from 
oceanoagraphic HF radar data. 

- Uses 4th order Runge-Kutta for accurate integration of discrete velocities
- Optional settings to simulate subgrid turbulence


HOW TO USE IT
- download it and add the unzipped directory to your MATLAB path
- start with the forthcomming example ...

NOTES

- .m files use functions as blocks of code, so code folding (for example using the 
  keyboard shortcut 'cmd =' ) makes it easy to move among these.
- Data structures contain variables of similar origin following the HFRProgs
  convention, rows = locations, cols = time
