## DRIFTER SIMULATION TOOLBOX FOR MATLAB ##

v9.1

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/198690464.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/198690464)

Tools for simulating drifters given gridded vector data, such as from 
oceanographic HF radar data. Use of this code has resulted in at least two papers, which are cited below.
Improvements developed for Matson et al. (2019), which includes error estimation, are not yet included here. 
Otherwise the toolbox includes:   

- Use of 4th order Runge-Kutta for accurate integration of discrete velocities.
- Optional settings to simulate subgrid turbulence.
- Dependencies in the /private folder. Also see the note about the use of code folding and subfunctions.

HOW TO USE IT
Download it and add the unzipped directory to your MATLAB path.

Run the example:
```
% EXAMPLE:
% Load TUV data in the HFRProgs TUV format (see test_data folder)
load ./test_data/drifter_simulation.mat TUV

% create drifter deployment location and time arrays: 
dstart = pacific2GMT(datenum(2015,5,20,11,0,0));
 
xy = [-120-10.68/60 34+25.38/60
      -120-09.12/60 34+26.22/60
      -120-09.42/60 34+27.30/60
      -120-08.58/60 34+26.52/60
      -120-06.03/60 34+27.67/60
      -120-06.03/60 34+27.67/60];

% Deploy a drifter at these locations at every time step in the TUV data:
% (These basically just need to have the same number of rows)
CFG.deploy_locations  = repmat(xy,length(TUV.TimeStamp),1); 
CFG.deploy_times = reshape( TUV.TimeStamp(:)*ones(1,size(xy,1)), numel(TUV.TimeStamp(:)*ones(1,size(xy,1))),1);

% Now run the code:
DRFT = drifter_simulation(TUV, CFG);

```

NOTES

- .m files use functions as blocks of code, so code folding (for example using the 
  keyboard shortcut 'cmd =' ) makes it easy to move among these.
- Data structures contain variables of similar origin following the HFRProgs
  convention, rows = locations, cols = time
